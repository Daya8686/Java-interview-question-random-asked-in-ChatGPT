# What is weak hash map in java

# WeakHashMap in Java

In Java, a `WeakHashMap` is a specialized implementation of the `Map` interface where the keys are stored as weak references. This allows keys that are no longer in use to be garbage collected, even if they are still present in the map. This is particularly useful for implementing memory-sensitive caches.

## Key Characteristics of WeakHashMap
- **Weak References**: The keys in a `WeakHashMap` are stored as weak references. A weak reference allows the referenced object to be garbage collected if it is no longer strongly reachable from elsewhere in the application.
- **Garbage Collection**: When a key is garbage collected, its corresponding entry is automatically removed from the map.
- **Thread-Safety**: `WeakHashMap` is not synchronized. If you need to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you should manually synchronize it or use `Collections.synchronizedMap`.

## Usage Example

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of `WeakHashMap`:

```java
import java.util.WeakHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class WeakHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Object, String> weakHashMap = new WeakHashMap<>();

        Object key1 = new Object();
        Object key2 = new Object();
        
        weakHashMap.put(key1, "Value1");
        weakHashMap.put(key2, "Value2");

        System.out.println("WeakHashMap before GC: " + weakHashMap);

        // Removing the strong references
        key1 = null;
        key2 = null;

        // Requesting garbage collection
        System.gc();

        // Giving the GC some time to run
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("WeakHashMap after GC: " + weakHashMap);
    }
}
```

# Explanation of Example

## Creation
A `WeakHashMap` is created with two key-value pairs.

## Nullify Keys
The strong references to the keys (`key1` and `key2`) are set to `null`.

## Garbage Collection
The garbage collector is explicitly invoked using `System.gc()`.

## WeakHashMap Content
After garbage collection, the `WeakHashMap` should be empty because the weakly referenced keys have been collected and their entries removed from the map.

# When to Use WeakHashMap

## Caching
When you need a cache where entries should be automatically removed when their keys are no longer in use.

## Memory-Sensitive Applications
In scenarios where managing memory usage is critical, and you want to ensure that objects can be garbage collected to free up memory.

# Summary

- **WeakHashMap**: A map implementation with keys stored as weak references.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatically removes entries with keys that are no longer reachable.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for caching and memory-sensitive applications where automatic removal of unused keys is beneficial.
- **Not Thread-Safe**: Needs manual synchronization if used in a multi-threaded environment.

Overall, `WeakHashMap` provides a convenient way to handle mappings with a built-in mechanism for handling memory management and garbage collection of keys.
