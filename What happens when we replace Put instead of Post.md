# What happeneds when we replace post with put as we know that put will also create resource in absence of resource then can we replace it with post and what are the issues?

# Using PUT instead of POST in HTTP

Using PUT instead of POST in HTTP for creating or updating resources has specific implications and potential issues, mainly due to the differences in how these methods are designed to work.

## Understanding POST and PUT:

### POST:
- **Purpose**: Used to create a new resource.
- **Behavior**: POST requests are not idempotent. Each time a POST request is sent, it typically results in a new resource being created on the server.
- **Endpoint**: Typically sent to a collection endpoint (e.g., /users), and the server decides the URI of the new resource (e.g., /users/123).

### PUT:
- **Purpose**: Used to create or update a resource at a specific URI.
- **Behavior**: PUT requests are idempotent, meaning multiple identical PUT requests will produce the same result as a single request. If the resource does not exist, PUT can create it. If it does exist, PUT will update it.
- **Endpoint**: Typically sent to the specific resource's URI (e.g., /users/123).

## What Happens When Replacing POST with PUT:

### Resource Creation:
- **POST**: When you use POST, the server typically generates the URI for the resource (like a new user) and returns it in the response.
- **PUT**: With PUT, you must specify the URI of the resource in the request. If the resource exists at that URI, it will be updated. If it doesn’t exist, it will be created.

### Idempotency:
- **POST**: Multiple POST requests usually create multiple resources, as each POST is treated as a new request.
- **PUT**: Multiple identical PUT requests result in the same state, as PUT is idempotent.

### Client Responsibility:
- **POST**: The client often doesn’t need to know the URI of the resource before creation. The server assigns it.
- **PUT**: The client needs to know or define the URI where the resource should be created or updated.

## Issues When Replacing POST with PUT:

### URI Management:
If you use PUT instead of POST, the client must manage the URI generation, which can lead to complications. For instance, if two clients attempt to create a resource with the same URI simultaneously, one might overwrite the other.

### Not Always Appropriate for Creation:
- **PUT**: Assumes that the client knows the specific URI where the resource should reside. If the URI is not meaningful or predictable, this can be impractical.
- In scenarios where the server should decide the resource's URI (e.g., auto-generated IDs), POST is more suitable.

### Side Effects of Idempotency:
In scenarios where each creation should result in a distinct new resource (like creating orders), PUT is inappropriate because it doesn’t guarantee uniqueness. Replacing POST with PUT in such cases can lead to unintended overwrites rather than the creation of separate resources.

### Semantics and REST Principles:
RESTful APIs are designed with specific semantics for POST and PUT. Using PUT in place of POST can confuse developers or clients who expect standard behavior based on the HTTP method used.

## Summary:
While PUT can technically replace POST for resource creation in certain situations, it’s generally not advisable due to the differences in their intended use, particularly regarding URI management, idempotency, and RESTful design principles. POST should be used when the server determines the resource URI or when the creation of distinct resources is required. PUT should be used when the client controls the resource URI and expects idempotent operations.
