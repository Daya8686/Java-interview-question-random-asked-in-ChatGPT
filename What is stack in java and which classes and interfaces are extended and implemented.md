# What is stack in java and which classes and interfaces are extended and implemented?

# Stack in Java

In Java, a stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The `java.util.Stack` class provides a standard implementation of a stack.

## Stack in Java
The `Stack` class is part of the `java.util` package and extends the `Vector` class. Here is a brief overview of the `Stack` class, its methods, and the hierarchy it follows:

### Hierarchy
`* java.lang.Object`
    *`java.util.AbstractCollection<E> `
        *`java.util.AbstractList<E>`
            *`java.util.Vector<E>`
                *`java.util.Stack<E>`
