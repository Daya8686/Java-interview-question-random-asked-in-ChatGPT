# What is class level lock and object level lock?

# Class-Level Locks and Object-Level Locks in Java

In Java, class-level locks and object-level locks are mechanisms used to control access to critical sections of code in a multi-threaded environment, ensuring that only one thread can execute certain blocks of code at a time. They are key to implementing thread synchronization and preventing data inconsistency due to concurrent access.

## 1. Object-Level Lock
**Definition**: An object-level lock is associated with a specific instance of a class. It is used to synchronize non-static methods or code blocks so that only one thread can execute a synchronized method or block on a particular object instance at any given time.

**Usage**: This lock is used when you want to synchronize access to instance methods or instance variables.

### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public synchronized void instanceMethod() {
        // Critical section
    }
    
    public void anotherInstanceMethod() {
        synchronized(this) {
            // Critical section
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `instanceMethod()` and the block inside `anotherInstanceMethod()` are synchronized on the instance (`this`). Only one thread can execute these methods on the same object instance at the same time.

## Scope:
The object-level lock is limited to the specific instance on which the synchronized method or block is called. Different instances of the same class have different locks.

## 2. Class-Level Lock
**Definition**: A class-level lock is associated with the `Class` object representing the class. It is used to synchronize static methods or static blocks of code, ensuring that only one thread can execute a synchronized static method or block for the entire class, regardless of the number of instances.

**Usage**: This lock is used when you need to synchronize access to static methods or static variables, which are shared among all instances of the class.

### Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public static synchronized void staticMethod() {
        // Critical section
    }
    
    public static void anotherStaticMethod() {
        synchronized(MyClass.class) {
            // Critical section
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `staticMethod()` and the block inside `anotherStaticMethod()` are synchronized on the `MyClass.class` object. Only one thread can execute these methods for the class at any given time, regardless of the number of instances.

## Scope:
The class-level lock is shared across all instances of the class. When a thread acquires the class-level lock, no other thread can execute any synchronized static methods or blocks in that class until the lock is released.

## Summary:
- **Object-Level Lock**: Synchronizes instance methods or blocks, allowing one thread at a time to access synchronized code on a particular object instance.
- **Class-Level Lock**: Synchronizes static methods or blocks, allowing one thread at a time to access synchronized static code for the entire class, regardless of the instance.

These locking mechanisms help prevent concurrent access issues in multi-threaded environments, ensuring that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner.
