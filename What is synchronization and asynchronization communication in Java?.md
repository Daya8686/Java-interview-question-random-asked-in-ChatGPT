# Synchronization and Asynchronization in Java

In Java, synchronization and asynchronization refer to different approaches to handling communication between threads or processes. They define how and when tasks are executed and how threads interact with each other or other components of a system.

## Synchronous Communication
Synchronous communication in Java means that the sender and the receiver are coordinated in time. The sender sends a message and waits for the receiver to process it and respond before continuing. This blocking behavior ensures that tasks are completed in a specific order.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Blocking**: The sender thread is blocked until the receiver processes the message and possibly returns a result.
- **Sequential Execution**: Tasks are performed one after another in a predetermined sequence.
- **Thread Safety**: Often used in conjunction with synchronized blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can access a resource at a time, preventing race conditions.

* ## Example:
Synchronized Method or Block: Ensures that only one thread can execute a method or block of code at a time.

```java

public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
    // Only one thread can execute this method at a time
}

// or

public void someMethod() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Critical section
    }
}

```

## Asynchronous Communication
Asynchronous communication in Java means that the sender and receiver are not coordinated in time. The sender sends a message and continues executing without waiting for the receiver to process the message. The tasks are executed independently, and the sender is not blocked.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Non-Blocking**: The sender thread continues its execution without waiting for a response.
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks can be executed concurrently, potentially improving performance.
- **Callback Mechanism**: Often involves callbacks, futures, or other mechanisms to handle the result once it is available.

### Example:
Using a Separate Thread or Executor Service: Tasks can be executed asynchronously, and the main thread does not have to wait for them to complete.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class AsyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            // Simulating a long-running task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            System.out.println("Task completed");
        }, executor);

        System.out.println("Main thread continues execution");

        future.join(); // Waits for the async task to complete
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Summary:
* **Synchronous Communication:** The sender waits for the receiver to complete the task, resulting in a blocking operation. It is commonly used when tasks must be performed sequentially and thread safety is a concern.
* **Asynchronous Communication:** The sender does not wait for the receiver, allowing for non-blocking operations and concurrent execution, which can lead to better performance in scenarios where tasks can run independently.
