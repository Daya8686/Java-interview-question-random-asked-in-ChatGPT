# When we are having anonymous classes then why lambda functions got introduced and what is the difference?

# Anonymous Classes and Lambda Expressions in Java

Anonymous classes and lambda expressions are both used to create instances of functional interfaces or to provide quick implementations of interfaces, but they have key differences and serve different purposes in Java. Here's a brief explanation:

## Anonymous Classes
Anonymous classes are inner classes without a name that are used to instantiate objects with certain modifications, usually for implementing interfaces or extending classes on the fly.

### Example:
```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class AnonymousClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Comparator<String> comparator = new Comparator<String>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
                return s1.compareTo(s2);
            }
        };
        
        System.out.println(comparator.compare("apple", "banana")); // Output: -1
    }
}
```

## Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions, introduced in Java 8, provide a more concise and readable way to implement functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method). They reduce boilerplate code and improve readability.

### Example:
```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Comparator<String> comparator = (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2);

        System.out.println(comparator.compare("apple", "banana")); // Output: -1
    }
}
```

# Key Differences

### Syntax:
- **Anonymous Classes**: Verbose, requiring explicit method definitions.
- **Lambdas**: Concise, with a focus on the implementation logic rather than boilerplate code.

### Readability:
- **Anonymous Classes**: Less readable due to more boilerplate code.
- **Lambdas**: More readable and expressive for single-method implementations.

### Scope:
- **Anonymous Classes**: Can have multiple methods and can access `this` to refer to the anonymous class instance.
- **Lambdas**: Can only implement single abstract methods from functional interfaces and cannot access `this` to refer to the lambda expression itself (instead, it refers to the enclosing instance).

### Use Cases:
- **Anonymous Classes**: Useful when you need to define a new class with multiple methods or when the interface has more than one abstract method.
- **Lambdas**: Ideal for implementing functional interfaces with a single method, especially in the context of collections, streams, and event handling.

## Why Lambda Expressions Were Introduced

### Boilerplate Reduction:
Lambdas remove much of the boilerplate code associated with anonymous classes, making code shorter and more expressive.

### Functional Programming:
Lambdas support a more functional programming style, which is useful in the context of Java Streams API and other functional programming paradigms.

### Readability and Maintenance:
Code with lambda expressions is often more readable and easier to maintain, especially when used for simple functional interface implementations.

### Parallel Processing:
Lambdas, in conjunction with streams, make it easier to write parallel processing code.
