# Avoiding the Breaking of Singleton Pattern

### Reflection Protection: 
To prevent reflection from breaking the singleton pattern, you can throw an exception if a second instance is attempted to be created from the constructor.

```java

public class Singleton {
    private static volatile boolean instanceCreated = false;

    private Singleton() {
        if (instanceCreated) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Use getInstance() method to get the single instance of this class.");
        }
        instanceCreated = true;
    }

      public static class SingletonHolder(){
        public static final Singleton INSTANCE=new Singleton();
      }
      
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
}

```

### Serialization Protection: 
Implement the `readResolve()` method to ensure that the same instance is returned when deserializing.

```java

private Object readResolve() {
    return getInstance(); // Return the existing instance
}

```

### Cloning Protection: 
Override the `clone()` method and throw a CloneNotSupportedException to prevent object duplication.

```java

@Override
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Cloning is not supported for Singleton class");
}
```
### Enum Singleton:
Using an enum singleton automatically protects against all these mechanisms (reflection, serialization, and cloning) because Java ensures enum constants are loaded only once per class loader and cannot be broken through reflection or serialization.
