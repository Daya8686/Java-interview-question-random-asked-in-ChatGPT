# Guaranteeing Thread-Safety of Singleton in a Multithreaded Environment

# Thread-Safety in Singleton Pattern for Multithreaded Environment

To guarantee thread-safety of a Singleton in a multithreaded environment, you can use the following approaches:

### 1. Double-Checked Locking:
This ensures that synchronization is done only when the instance is `null`, avoiding performance overhead once the instance is created.

### Example:
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 2.Eager Initialization:
The instance is created at the time of class loading, which ensures thread-safety but might waste resources if the instance is never used.

```java

public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 3.Bill Pugh Singleton Design: 
This is a thread-safe and lazy initialization approach without the need for synchronization.

```java

public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {}

    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```
### 4.Enum Singleton: 
The best way to ensure thread-safety and avoid breaking through serialization, reflection, or cloning.

```java

public enum Singleton {
    INSTANCE;

    public void someMethod() {
        // Business logic
    }
}
```
### 5.Synchronized Method: 
A simple solution, but it has performance issues due to synchronization every time getInstance() is called.

```java

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
These five approaches ensure thread-safety for singleton creation in a multithreaded environment
