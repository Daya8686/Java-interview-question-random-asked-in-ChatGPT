# Implementing Singleton in Java to Prevent Issues with Multiple Class Loaders

To implement a singleton that avoids issues caused by multiple class loaders, the best approach is to use an enum-based Singleton or apply the Bill Pugh Singleton Design with proper class loading and synchronization mechanisms.

## Enum-Based Singleton
The enum-based singleton is the most effective and simplest way to prevent issues caused by multiple class loaders. Java ensures that any enum value is instantiated only once in a Java program, and it handles serialization and thread-safety by default.

### Example:
```java
public enum Singleton {
    INSTANCE;
    
    public void doSomething() {
        // Your logic here
    }
}
```

This implementation is thread-safe and protects against multiple instantiations by multiple class loaders or even during serialization/deserialization.

## Bill Pugh Singleton Design (Lazy Initialization using Holder Class)
This method uses a static inner class to ensure thread-safety and lazy initialization without requiring synchronization.

### Example:
```java
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    private static class SingletonHolder {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

This approach works well with multiple class loaders because the static inner class is not loaded until it is referenced. This ensures that the singleton is created only once, regardless of the class loaders involved.
